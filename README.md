### Hi there üëã

My name is **Rodrigo**, nice to meet you! 

I am a Backend Developer from Madrid, Spain and I am a passionate of Javascript/Typescript. Even though I am a FullStack profile, who has worked with both React and Angular in the frontend, I have to confess you that I enjoy more working on the backend side of a project.

- üî≠ I'm constantly working on personal projects based on ideas that come up to my mind.
- üë• I'm a team-player and I enjoy getting feedback from different points of view. Team-work makes the dream-work, right?
- üí¨ Ask me about sports, tech or anything that you want. I am open to any conversation.
- üòÑ Pronouns: He/Him.
- üìÖ My goal in the short-term is to start publishing articles on Medium.
- üå± I'm currently improving my communication skills.
- üì± I have published multiple mobile apps on the App Store/Google Play Store.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: Two of my bestfriends are Italians and I like pineapple on pizza so we can't go to pizza shops.
- üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering by the University Charles III of Madrid.

### Biggest achievement

As I mentioned, I have published myself some personal and professional mobile apps for both iOS and Android. Even though most of the times were developed as a freelancer, I took my free time to start developing my own apps. My biggest achievement until today is that, during the summer of 2020, during the COVID situation, the beaches of Italy had a problem. They did not know how to handle the capacity of their beaches, that is, how to control the amount of people in each beach without exceeding the limit established by the government. 

That is when my Italian friends and I came up with the idea of creating an app that could control this capacity in real-time, and provide this information to the public so that they could know if it was a good idea to go to a certain beach. And that is how Spiaggiati was created!

I have to say that it was not the most challenging app in terms of logic, but it was in terms of time. The deadline that we had to develop the business model, as well as the app was just 2 weeks! 


Some Stats:

- More than 100K downloads across all platforms
- +5K daily unique users
- Working in more than 80 beaches across Italy 
- Top 5 app in Apple Store Italy in the Travel category
- Top 100 app in Google Play Store Italy overall
